<h1>Kickfurther Investment Statistics</h1>
<div class='about'>
<a href='http://kickfurther.com/s/j1x8s3zjrv'>Kickfurther</a> is a crowd funding platform similar to kickstarter. The difference is that with kickfurther you invest and get a monetary return. 
<p>
Existing companies raise a certain amount of funds and then promise to pay back those funds plus a percentage to their backers. 
<p>
The following is a graphical representation of funded and completed companies. The data was gathered using Python from the kickfurther website. The graph was made using d3.js.
<p>
Larger circles represent more funds raised, and lighter colors represent a higher return. Red are completed offers, green are funded but not yet (as of Jan 18, 2016) completed.

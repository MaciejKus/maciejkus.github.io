    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Record Collector is a simple game I made using the <a href='http://enchantjs.com/'>enchant.js</a> game engine. It was largely an exercise in JavaScript and using a game engine, but I also wanted to add my own flavor to the incremental game genre. Most incremental games are text and box based, where you click buttons or objects. In Record Collector you control a hero who walks around and interacts with other characters while trying to get more records.</p>


<p>I chose enchant.js because it was small and simple. I did not want a framework that would do all the work for me. I meant this to be a learning experience for myself, and it was. I never made a game more advanced than pong before this. Here I had to not only code the game, but also design the game play and the graphics (my apologies. I am clearly not an artist.) Enchant helped me create the map and I was able to avoid writing my own collision detection function. But by and large the game is my own creation.</p>


<!-- more -->


<p>The biggest challenge while creating the game may have been to make the map and sprites scroll correctly while the hero moved around. Moving the hero around requires the game to look at the hero&#8217;s current position (x and y), the last mouse click and the speed at which the hero walks. First I check to make sure that the mouse click is close enough to the hero that the hero does not really have to walk. If the distance between the mouse click and the current hero&#8217;s position is less than the hero&#8217;s walking speed I just move the hero the the mouse-click position. If the mouse-click is further away, I check a number of things. I see how close the hero is to the current edge or the map. If he is one third of the way to the edge of the direction he will be walking then I will scroll the background. I also check to make sure that there is more background to scroll into. Maybe the map has ended, in which case there is no need for further scrolling. I also make sure that there are no collisions with walls in the direction the hero is trying to move. If all of the above checks, then I change the background position (x and/or y) to make the background scroll, and then I change the position of the mouse-click to bring it closer to the position of the hero. The hero&#8217;s x and y positions do not change in this case because the hero&#8217;s sprite does not actually move relative to the window. It is the background that is moving and bringing the mouse-click point closer to the hero.
</p>


<p>If all the above checks failed, then that means I am probably near the edge of a map. There is probably no more background left to scroll. In this case I leave the background and the mouse-click points alone and I move the hero&#8217;s sprite. I also check for collision with walls one last time, and if a collision occurs, I undo the hero&#8217;s move.</p>


<p></p>

<p>The code is a bit hard to read as I have some magic numbers in there to make collisions with walls look better. But it goes something like this:

One other implementation that I had to think about was what to do about collisions. Enchant.js does a good job of making collision detection easy, but when the hero collides with another character in the game I wanted the dialogue box to pop up only a single time per collision. This was solved with having the none player characters all having a &#8216;hit&#8217; property. So first the game checks for a collision, and if there is a collision it checks to make sure that the hit property is set to false. If it is set to false, then the dialogue box is rendered and the hit property is set to true. The hit property stays true until the collision no longer exists. If there is no collision then the hit property is set to false again. This is the code that loops through all the characters to see if they have collided with the hero.

    <updated>2014-07-27T14:08:58-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://maciejkus.com/blog/2014/07/27/the-best-subnetting-site</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently began to study for the CCNA. I am taking my sweet time with it, mostly because I have instead ended up working on improving my JavaScript skills. One way I combined the two was by creating a <a href='http://subnettingpractice.com'>subnetting practice</a> website. I found existing subnetting sites to be lacking. They were mostly text based with the same nine or so question types repeated over and over. These questions do little to teach someone when and why to actually use subnetting. They make sure the student knows how to calculate a subnet mask, but not how to implement that knowledge when given a network diagram. The site I created uses graphical questions and diagrams along with text based questions to make sure the learner knows how to calculate things like the network mask, but also knows when and why to calculate it.</p>


<!-- more -->


<p>I built the site from scratch. Originally I was going to only create the subnetting practice section of the site, but soon I realized that to write the type of questions I was wanting to write I would need to program a way to calculate variable length subnet mask (VLSM) subnetting, so I wrote a <a href='http://subnettingpractice.com/vlsm.html'>VLSM calculator</a>. Once I had this coded, I was able to create VLSM style questions. </p>


<p>The Internet is moving towards IPv6 implementation and the CCNA is beginning to reflect that with IPv6 questions being added to the test. Because of this I added some fairly basic (but more than one should need for the CCNA) <a href=http://subnettingpractice.com/ipv6.html>IPv6 questions</a>. There are a number of other features, including exponent practice, basic subnetting practice, and interactive view of how large IPv6 is, and IPv6 and IPv4 calculators.</p>


<p>I find the sit to be useful, both in making sure my subneting is accurate and quick and in checking my work with the calculators. It&#8217;s nice to code something that is of value to me and others.</p>

    <link href="http://maciejkus.com/blog/2014/07/26/setting-up-octopress/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-26T12:13:08-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://maciejkus.com/blog/2014/07/26/setting-up-octopress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This site is powered by Octopress. Octopress is a static site generator. I am still working on getting things to look just how I want, but I am pretty happy so far. For a website I want something simple and to the point. I want content to be the first thing a visitor sees. </p>


<p>A lot of webpages, especially those that use Twitter Bootstrap hide the content. Instead when visiting a page the user is greeted with a full-screen image or graphic of some kind. Usually the user is expected to scroll down to view the actual content of the site, and even then instead of content the site is filled with links and more images. This may be impressive the first time one sees such a  page, but usually I am looking for information and not pretty graphics. I hope my site remains simple and content is accessible. Users should never feel like they have to search  through a site to find content. </p>

<p>With all that in mind, I did have a couple issues when setting up Octopress. First, when installing either the default theme or the <a href ='https://github.com/shashankmehta/greyshade'>Greyshade</a> theme which I ended up using, I received the following errors:

The issue ended up being that my Gemfile was pointing to an old version of stringex. To get things working I changed my Gemfile from
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>gem 'stringex', '~> 1.4.0'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
to
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>gem 'stringex', '~> 2.5.2'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
</p>


<p>The second issue was that when I moved the default index.html file to blog/index.html as described on the Octopress <a href='http://octopress.org/docs/theme/template/'>website</a> blog/index.html would show up blank. There was no blog entries being listed on the page. When I moved the file back to the home directory the most recent blog posts once again showed up. The fix was to update _config.yml and set 
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>paginate_path: "posts/:num"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
to 
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>paginate_path: "blog/posts/:num"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
It&#8217;s a simple step that the Octopress documentation did not mention.</p>


<p>Beyond that, the setup was pretty painless.</p>

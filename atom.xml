    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently began to study for the CCNA. I am taking my sweet time with it, mostly because I have instead ended up working on improving my JavaScript skills. One way I combined the two was by creating a <a href='http://subnettingpractice.com'>subnetting practice</a> website. I found existing subnetting sites to be lacking. They were mostly text based with the same nine or so question types repeated over and over. These questions do little to teach someone when and why to actually use subnetting. They make sure the student knows how to calculate a subnet mask, but not how to implement that knowledge when given a network diagram. The site I created uses graphical questions and diagrams along with text based questions to make sure the learner knows how to calculate things like the network mask, but also knows when and why to calculate it.</p>

<p>I built the site from scratch. Originally I was going to only create the subnetting practice section of the site, but soon I realized that to write the type of questions I was wanting to write I would need to program a way to calculate variable length subnet mask (VLSM) subnetting, so I wrote a <a href='http://subnettingpractice.com/vlsm.html'>VLSM calculator</a>. Once I had this coded, I was able to create VLSM style questions. </p>


<p>The Internet is moving towards IPv6 implementation and the CCNA is beginning to reflect that with IPv6 questions being added to the test. Because of this I added some fairly basic (but more than one should need for the CCNA) <a href=http://subnettingpractice.com/ipv6.html>IPv6 questions</a>. There are a number of other features, including exponent practice, basic subnetting practice, and interactive view of how large IPv6 is, and IPv6 and IPv4 calculators.</p>


<p>I find the sit to be useful, both in making sure my subneting is accurate and quick and in checking my work with the calculators. It&#8217;s nice to code something that is of value to me and others.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This site is powered by Octopress. Octopress is a static site generator. I am still working on getting things to look just how I want, but I am pretty happy so far. For a website I want something simple and to the point. I want content to be the first thing a visitor sees. </p>


<p>A lot of webpages, especially those that use Twitter Bootstrap hide the content. Instead when visiting a page the user is greeted with a full-screen image or graphic of some kind. Usually the user is expected to scroll down to view the actual content of the site, and even then instead of content the site is filled with links and more images. This may be impressive the first time one sees such a  page, but usually I am looking for information and not pretty graphics. I hope my site remains simple and content is accessible. Users should never feel like they have to search  through a site to find content. </p>

<p>With all that in mind, I did have a couple issues when setting up Octopress. First, when installing either the default theme or the <a href ='https://github.com/shashankmehta/greyshade'>Greyshade</a> theme which I ended up using, I received the following errors:
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>:rake install

</span><span class='line'>(See full trace by running task with --trace)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
and
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>/usr/local/bin/rake:23:in `&lt;main>'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

The issue ended up being that my Gemfile was pointing to an old version of stringex. To get things working I changed my Gemfile from
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>gem 'stringex', '~> 1.4.0'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
to
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>gem 'stringex', '~> 2.5.2'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
</p>


<p>The second issue was that when I moved the default index.html file to blog/index.html as described on the Octopress <a href='http://octopress.org/docs/theme/template/'>website</a> blog/index.html would show up blank. There was no blog entries being listed on the page. When I moved the file back to the home directory the most recent blog posts once again showed up. The fix was to update _config.yml and set 
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>paginate_path: "posts/:num"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
to 
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>paginate_path: "blog/posts/:num"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
It&#8217;s a simple step that the Octopress documentation did not mention.</p>


<p>Beyond that, the setup was pretty painless.</p>

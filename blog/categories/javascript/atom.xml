    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I decided to make a match three game as a first step to learning a new game engine. Since Enchant.js is pretty much abandoned at this point, I figured it was time to try something new, and I decided on Phaser.js. So I start making the game, but it just seems that using a game engine was overkill for something as simple as a match-three game.</p>

<p>So I decided to save learning Phaser.js for a different project and just make the match-three game using plain old vanilla JavaScript and the html5 canvas element. Play it <a href='http://brogress.smoothiegains.com/smoothie_match/'>here</a>.</p>

<p>The coolest thing about making the game was dealing with all the animations. I split up the animations to only render the tile which is moving, instead of rendering the whole canvas every time something has to be changed. This saves a lot of resources, making the game run faster and smoother. The trick was to make sure that things didn&rsquo;t overlap.  The animations run asynchronously, so I had to avoid situations where multiple animations were running on top of one another, or that the logic from a running animation did not interfere with the logic of a new mouse click.</p>

<p>The game is pretty basic, but I was able to remove all the little glitches I came across when testing. I&rsquo;m also pleased to have made a game where the graphics actually look OK. This is all thanks to finding creative commons images and playing with GIMP a little bit.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s a project, JavaScript <a href="http://www.jsbreakouts.org/">Breakouts</a> which is a collection of different JavaScript game engines. All the game engines are used to create the same version of Breakout, with the same features, etc. It&rsquo;s a way to allow people to compare different game engines by looking at them in action.</p>

<p>Since I&rsquo;ve used enchant.js before, I figured I would add an enchant.js version to the Breakouts. The game can be played <a href="http://www.jsbreakouts.org/enchantjs/index.html">here</a>. Coding this game I realized that enchant.js is out of date. The last time it has been updated was around 2013. There was one <a href="https://github.com/wise9/enchant.js/issues/312">issue</a> where I actually had to go in and change the code for enchant.js to make the game work. There is an outdated web audio line:</p>

<p><code>this.src.disconnect(this.connectTarget);</code></p>

<p>This caused Chrome and other webkit based browsers to issue a</p>

<p><code>Uncaught InvalidAccessError: Failed to execute 'disconnect' on 'AudioNode': the given destination is not connected.</code></p>

<p>error. This was fixed by changing the above line to</p>

<p><code>this.src.disconnect();</code></p>

<p>Before this change, the game would crash as soon as a sound was played. I see there are other issues with enchant.js. On older versions of Firefox the game does not finish loading. Instead it throws a</p>

<p><code>Error: failed in Deferred</code></p>

<p>error. It&rsquo;s unfortunate, but it seems like enchant.js is no longer being maintained, and so I will have to find a new game engine to use, if I ever decide to use a game engine for a game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I made a fairly simply tower defense game in html5/canvas/javascript. It works fine as is. Most of the features I would want to create are there, the game just needs some work on the actual game play. Details like the cost of towers, and how rapid the attackers are spawned will probably need to be changed to make the game more enjoyable. The current version works well enough to play.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p> There is a shocking lack of box and whisker graph calculators on the Internet. Well, accurate ones anyway, so I made one. Originally I needed one for some calculations I was doing and made one in Python, but then I figured I can easily rewrite it into Javascript and make it available for others. I even added a simple HTML5 canvas graph. You can find it at <a href="http://maciejkus.com/box_whiskers/">Box and Whiskers Calculator</a></p>

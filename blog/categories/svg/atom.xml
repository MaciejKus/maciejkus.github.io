    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wrote a little turn based game. It is inspired by American involvement in the Middle East. The idea is you are newly elected President Obama. You inherited two wars. What actions will you take in the Middle East?</p>


<p>Since 2008 the Middle East has seen a dramatic change in political aliances. The Arab Spring had a huge impact on the regoin. Recently the Hamas and Israel conflict showed just how profound that impact has been. Egypt and other Arab countries were more inclined to ally with Israel than they were with Islamic Hamas. That is just a single example of how dynamic the Middle East is.</p>


<p>The game starts somewhat realistically to what Obama found when he became president. “With the 2008 election of Barack Obama, favorable attitudes toward the U.S. more than doubled in many Arab countries.” (<a href='http://www.aaiusa.org/reports/arab-attitudes-2011'>aaiusa</a>) I used a number of sources for the game. These include:</p>

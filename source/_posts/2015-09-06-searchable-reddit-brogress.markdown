description: I made a searchable fitness progress site using angularJS
---
Reddit has a number of fitness progress picture communities. The problem is there is no good way to search through the posts. A lot of the posts are either people trying to lose weight, or 16 year olds who gain 30 pounds of muscle in 3 months. I am not interested in losing weight, nor do I have the raging growth hormones of a teenager.

I wanted to be able to search through the posts to find photos of people similar to me in height and weight so I could have a realistic fitness goal to strive for when I go to the gym. So, using angularJS I made my own. 

I present the world with a <a href='http://brogress.smoothiegains.com/'>searchable fitness photo</a> web app.

I have made a smoothie calculator web app using jquery and javascript for my own use in the past. I used it to calculate the amount of calories, proteins, fats and carbs in a smoothie recipe. 

Now I have made a very similar <a href="http://smoothiegains.com/smoothie-calculator/">smoothie calculator</a> using reactjs and bootstrap. I have plans to add a few more features to this new calculator, so I figured using a framework like react is a good way to ensure that the code does not become a huge mess as I add more functions and features.

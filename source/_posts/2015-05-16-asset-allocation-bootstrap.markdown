Another bootstrap project is the <a href='http://maciejkus.com/asset-allocation/'>asset allocation calculator</a> I created. The JavaScript is mostly simple math and there's some jQuery to create and remove fields. Thanks to bootstrap the page is responsive, works well across browsers and looks pretty.

description: What I've been up to in the last couple of weeks

There's a lot of todo apps out there, but I finally got around to making one myself. I used Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js for most of it and then just added a very simple HTML front end. I have plans to one day add a nicer front end, most likely using Angular2, which I have recently been playing with.

Until I polish the frontend up a bit I think I will keep the app to myself, but I do like to post notes on what I have been up to here and there.

On the Angular2 side of things, I did learn a valuable lesson. When learning a new framework that recommends a language that you are not familiar with, learn that language first. Most of the confusion I encountered when I first looked at Angural2 was simply due to TypeScript syntax that I was not familiar with. Once I got that figured out it wasn't bad at all.

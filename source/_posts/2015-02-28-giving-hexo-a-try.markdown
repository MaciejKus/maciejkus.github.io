description: Trying out Hexo to generate a static site
---

I'm building a new website using Hexo, a javascript based static site generator.  This blog runs using Octopress, which is OK, but I don't know anything about Ruby and generating content seems to take longer than I would like. The author of Octopress isn't very [happy](http://octopress.org/2015/01/15/octopress-3.0-is-coming/) with where the platform currently is and is rewriting it. So I figure it's a great time to try something new.

I chose Hexo largely because it is written in Javascript and because it has some nice themes made and ready to go. Well, I am still customizing the theme I chose, but it's less work to edit an existing theme than start one up from scratch. Having dealt with Octopress I am somewhat used to a static blogging platform and for the most part things aren't all that different. I'm using markdown for the first time ever, and boy is it nice. It's one of those things where I'd rather start with HTML and then once I understand it try markdown in the same way I would rather learn vanilla Javascript before playing with jQuery or a framework. It's nice knowing what is going on 'under the hood'. I'm also going to get more familiar with EJS because that is what much of the theme I am working with is written in. It's a bit confusing at first glance, but I bet, like markdown will make sense and make life easier.

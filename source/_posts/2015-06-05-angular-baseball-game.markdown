description: A simple javascript baseball game.

Inspired by a Codewars kata I created a simple [baseball game](http://maciejkus.com/baseball-game/). It was the first time I used AngularJS, but I feel like the Angular was unnecessary. I will need to build a few other pages to get the full idea of Angular.

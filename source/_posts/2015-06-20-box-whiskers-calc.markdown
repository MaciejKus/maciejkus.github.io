 There is a shocking lack of box and whisker graph calculators on the Internet. Well, accurate ones anyway, so I made one. Originally I needed one for some calculations I was doing and made one in Python, but then I figured I can easily rewrite it into Javascript and make it available for others. I even added a simple HTML5 canvas graph. You can find it at [Box and Whiskers Calculator](http://maciejkus.com/box_whiskers/)

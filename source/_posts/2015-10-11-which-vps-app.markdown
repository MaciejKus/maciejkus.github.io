description: an app which compares VPS providers
---

I made a list of the <a href='http://adminhacks.com/vps-compare.html'>best VPS hosting</a> providers and threw that information into an angular.js webapp. I used bootstrap for the style of the page.

As far as I can tell the VPS hosts in the app are the most dependable and most well known in the industry. I hope the app is useful to those looking to get a new virtual private server.

A D3.js graph of Rolling Stone magazine's 100 greatest singers. The data was scraped from a downloaded version of the html file form Rolling Stone magazine. The node.js file used to scrape the data is rs-data/scrape.js.

D3.js was then used to build a force graph of the data showing which artist influenced which other artist.

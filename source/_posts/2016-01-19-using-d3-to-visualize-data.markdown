description: Using d3.js to visualize some kickfurther investing data
---

I started playing with d3.js, a visualization library. I got some data from the kickfurther website using a little python script I wrote. The script parsed out the relevant data and saved it as a JavaScript object.

From there I used <a href='http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345'>Interactive Data Visualization for the Web</a> as an intro to d3.js and built a fun little bubble graph. I don't know if a bubble graph is the most informative way to present this data, but it was the coolest looking, and mainly I was attempting to learn d3.js. 

Check out my <a href='/kickfurther-data/'>Kickfurther visualization</a>.

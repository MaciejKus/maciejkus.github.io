//maybe a graph of some kind, kinda like hat i made for the math site?
//make this more of an about me page than resume. maybe just have 'behind the door' kind things. like a squar that reads 'javascript' and when clicked on it spins around to reveal a message from me about my javascript skills, etc. the page will be a bunch of these squares with a title at the top 'How MAciej Can Help You'

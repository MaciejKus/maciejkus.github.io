<div class='about'>
<a href='http://kickfurther.com/s/j1x8s3zjrv'>Kickfurther</a> is a crowd funding platform similar to kickstarter. The difference is that with kickfurther you invest and get a monetary return. 
<p>
Existing companies raise a certain amount of funds and then promise to pay back those funds plus a percentage to their backers. 
<p>
The following is a graphical representation of funded and completed companies. The data was gathered using Python from the kickfurther website. The graph was made using d3.js.
<p>
Larger circles represent more funds raised, and lighter colors represent a higher return. Red are completed offers, green are funded but not yet (as of Jan 18, 2016) completed.
<p>
The mean amount raised for completed offers is $8,099 with a mean percent return of 9.2% The monthly return mean was 2.33%. For funded offers the mean amount raised is $20,921 and the mean return is 10.9%. The currently listed funded offers have a monthly mean return of 1.80%.
